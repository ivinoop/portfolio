# What is Python?

In very complex words, `Python is a high-level, general purpose programming langauge. The design and syntax of the langauge focuses on code readability with the use of indentation as a signifying structure.`

For those of us who are familiar with other programming langauges, Python is a breath of fresh air where our focus can be put on writing more actionable code rather than worrying about making it work - because Python just works!

Python is also dynamically typed and garbage collected.
